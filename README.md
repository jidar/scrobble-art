scrobble-art
============

Creates personalized album and artist image montages based on Last.FM scrobble info.

### History and Plans
This is a renovation of an quick script I wrote in 2012 one day to create a neat background.
I plan on (at least) implementing the features outlined in --help, as well as making the codebase more maintainable.
If time permits, I'd also like to use a python imagemagick library, instead of shell execs, to increase portability
